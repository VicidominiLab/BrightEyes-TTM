**Please note the following exceptions.**

[FX3 interface module](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/BrightEyes-TTM/blob/v1.0/FPGA/ttm/hdl/to_fxr_workaround.v):
the Verilog module used to interface the FPGA to the Cypress FX3, is derived
from the Cypress Application note AN65974 - Designing with the EZ-USB™ FX3
slave FIFO interface <https://www.cypress.com/documentation/application-notes/an65974-designing-ez-usb-fx3-slave-fifo-interface> is under a Cypress License.

[SYLAP](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/BrightEyes-TTM/blob/main/FPGA/ttm/hdl/sylap/):
SYLAP (Simulate Your Laser and Photons) is not part of the TTM module as
it can be disactivated in the top level of the FPGA code. The is has been
aggregated to the TTM for debugging purpose. The license of SYLAP it is
the License GPLv2.1 the original repository is <https://github.com/VicidominiLab/SYLAP>

[Data Receiver for Linux](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/BrightEyes-TTM/blob/main/FPGAdataReceiver/linux/):
is the License GPLv2 as derivates from cyusb_linux_1.0.5 which is part of
the Cypress EZ-USB FX3 SDK 1.3.4 for Linux. It can be downloaded from
<https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/ez-usb-fx3-software-development-kit>
and it can be found also here <https://github.com/Ho-Ro/cyusb_linux>

[Data Receiver for Windows](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/BrightEyes-TTM/blob/main/dataReceiver/windows/):
is the License GPLv2 as derivates from cyusb_linux_1.0.5 which is part of
the Cypress EZ-USB FX3 SDK 1.3.4 for Linux and then adapted to Windows.
This version uses also libUSB and POSIX Threads for Win32 libraries both
under LGPLv2.1.

[SPAD-FFS libraries](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/libspadffs/tree/ttm/):
the libraries for the analysis of confocal laser-scanning microscopy based fluorescence
fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) data analysis is under a BSD-3-Clause. The original version
is <https://github.com/VicidominiLab/spad-ffs>
