# Welcome to BrightEyes-TTM's documentation!

The **BrightEyes-TTM is an open-source project** which consists in a **data-acquisition card** able to implement the so-called photon time-tagging acquisition mode with a **time resolution of ~30ps** designed for microscopy and based on a **commercial FPGA Xilinx Kintex-7**.

The BrightEyes-TTM project born as an offshoot of the BrighEyes project founded by the ERC in 2018 (Consolidator Grant, N. 818699). The principal aim of the BrightEyes-TTM project is to give to any microscopy laboratory the possibility to implement and further develop single-photon microscopy. The second aim is to trigger the interest of the microscopy community, and establish the BrigthEyes-TTM as a new standard for single-photon laser scanning microscopy (LSM) experiments.
