# Welcome to BrightEyes-TTM's documentation!

The **BrightEyes-TTM is an open-source project** which consists in a **data-acquisition card** able to implement the so-called photon time-tagging acquisition mode with a **time resolution of ~30ps** designed for microscopy and based on a **commercial FPGA Xilinx Kintex-7**.

The BrightEyes-TTM project born as an offshoot of the BrighEyes project founded by the ERC in 2018 (Consolidator Grant, N. 818699). The principal aim of the BrightEyes-TTM project is to give to any microscopy laboratory the possibility to implement and further develop single-photon microscopy. The second aim is to trigger the interest of the microscopy community, and establish the BrigthEyes-TTM as a new standard for single-photon laser scanning microscopy (LSM) experiments.

**The BrightEyes-TTM as an open-source time-tagging module for democratising single-photon microscopy.** _Rossetta, A., Slenders, E., Donato, M. et al._  **Nature Communications** 13, 7406 (2022). <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35064-0>

There are two version of BrightEyes-TTM. The article on arXiv is referred to the version v1.0, the article published on Nature Communications is refered to the version v2.0.
